Translation App will be a simple SPA application that provides users the ability to translate to and from any global language. 
Users will also be allowed to create accounts and remember translations up to two weeks old. 


SCHEMA:

There will be two tables: one for users and another for translation history. While one user can have many translation texts in history, no single translation can have
multiple users. As such, this will be a one-to-many relationship.

Utilizing PostgreSQL, here are the schema designs.


Users:
user_id,
username,
email,
password,
created_at (timestamp)


Translation_History:
translation_id,
user_id,
source_text,
source_language,
target_text,
target_language,
timestamp
